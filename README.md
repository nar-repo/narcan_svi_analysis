# Narcan Distribution and Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) Analysis

This project analyzes the relationship between Narcan (naloxone) site availability and the CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) across census tracts. It explores whether higher social vulnerability corresponds with greater access to life-saving overdose prevention tools.

---

## Objective

To evaluate whether social vulnerability ‚Äî as measured by the CDC's SVI and its subthemes ‚Äî predicts the availability of Narcan distribution sites per 1,000 residents.

---

## Data Sources

- Narcan Site Locations: [Insert source or description]
- SVI Data: CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index
- Census Tract Boundaries: US Census Bureau (TIGER/Line shapefiles)

---

## Methods

1. Geospatial Join: Linked Narcan sites to census tracts.
2. Rate Calculation: Computed Narcan site counts per 1,000 population (`narcan_per_1000`).
3. Log Transformation: Applied log(x + 1) to address skewness in Narcan distribution.
4. Statistical Analysis:
   - Pearson correlation between SVI and Narcan per capita.
   - OLS regression with full SVI and individual themes (`RPL_THEME1` to `RPL_THEME4`).
   - Multivariate modeling to assess individual contribution of each SVI theme.

---

## Key Findings

- Pearson correlation: Very weak (r ‚âà 0.00), not statistically significant.
- Simple regression: No meaningful relationship between overall SVI and Narcan availability.
- Multivariate model:
  - R¬≤ = 0.006 (very low explanatory power)
  - Slight but statistically significant associations for a couple of themes
  - Overall, model indicates SVI is not a strong predictor of Narcan site distribution

---

## Interpretation

Despite expectations, social vulnerability alone does not explain variation in Narcan access across tracts. This suggests that other factors ‚Äî such as policy decisions, local programs, or overdose rates ‚Äî may play a larger role.

---

## Limitations

- Narcan site data may be incomplete or outdated
- Does not account for overdoses, emergency services, or lived experience
- OLS model assumes independence, which may not hold with spatial data

---

## Repository Structure

--------------------
Interpretation in Your Project‚Äôs Context
From your model results:

RPL_THEME2: Significant Negative Association

Areas with more vulnerable household characteristics (e.g., older adults, disabilities, single parents) are less likely to have Narcan access.

This could signal a gap in harm reduction outreach or systemic neglect.

RPL_THEME3: Significant Positive Association

Areas with higher minority/language vulnerability have more Narcan sites.

Possibly reflects targeted public health interventions in minority-dense urban areas.

RPL_THEME1 & RPL_THEME4: Not Significant

Socioeconomic status and housing/transport vulnerability didn‚Äôt show strong relationships with Narcan availability in your model.

This kind of interpretation is crucial for your GitHub README and for presenting the project on your resume or in interviews ‚Äî it connects the numbers back to real-world policy and health equity implications.

üìä Regression Summary & Interpretation
Model Overview:

Dependent Variable: Log-transformed Narcan site availability per 1,000 people (narcan_per_1000_log)

Independent Variables: Four SVI themes (RPL_THEME1 to RPL_THEME4)

R¬≤ = 0.006: The model explains only 0.6% of the variance in Narcan availability ‚Äî suggesting a very weak fit.

F-statistic p = 0.0477: The overall model is statistically significant, but the practical value is minimal given the low R¬≤.

üîç Coefficient Interpretation
Predictor	Coef.	p-value	Interpretation
RPL_THEME1 (Socioeconomic Status)	+0.0060	0.508	Not statistically significant
RPL_THEME2 (Household Characteristics)	‚àí0.0157	0.023	Higher vulnerability ‚Üí fewer Narcan sites
RPL_THEME3 (Minority Status & Language)	+0.0131	0.039	Higher vulnerability ‚Üí more Narcan sites
RPL_THEME4 (Housing & Transportation)	+0.0097	0.258	Not statistically significant

Significant Predictors:

RPL_THEME2 suggests underserved populations like elderly, disabled, or single-parent households may face reduced Narcan access.

RPL_THEME3 may indicate that minority-heavy areas are seeing more public health outreach.

‚ö†Ô∏è Model Assumptions Violated
Residual Skewness: Severe positive skew (Skew = 12.38), indicating non-normal residuals. This undermines p-values and confidence intervals.

Kurtosis = 178.79: Extreme outliers.

Durbin-Watson = 1.275: Positive autocorrelation.

Condition Number = 409: Suggests multicollinearity, which weakens the reliability of individual predictors.

üß† Final Takeaway
This model reveals statistically significant but weak relationships between select SVI themes and Narcan distribution. The findings suggest potential equity gaps, especially for vulnerable households, but due to poor model performance and assumption violations, results should be interpreted cautiously. Further research with richer data or non-linear methods (e.g. spatial models or decision trees) could be more informative.

given this reflection from Gemini, should I still post it on github for my resume?


ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî you should post this project on GitHub. Here's why:

‚úÖ Why It Still Belongs on GitHub
Shows Real-World Data Skills

You worked with complex spatial and socioeconomic data.

You performed data cleaning, merging, and transformation ‚Äî which are core data analyst and data science skills.

Demonstrates Critical Thinking

Your reflection shows that you understand model limitations, statistical assumptions, and interpretation of weak results. This is more valuable than flashy metrics with no substance.

Transparency Is a Strength

Being honest about a poor model fit, and explaining why it happened, sets you apart. Most real-world models don't look good ‚Äî but few people are confident enough to talk about it clearly.

Highlights Tool Proficiency

You used pandas, geopandas, statsmodels, and likely Power BI or a visualization tool. This stack is very relevant in public health, urban planning, and policy analytics.

It‚Äôs a Conversation Starter

In interviews, this project gives you a story: ‚ÄúI explored the link between Narcan access and social vulnerability ‚Äî and here‚Äôs what I found and what didn‚Äôt work.‚Äù That kind of nuance is memorable.

üõ† How to Frame It in Your GitHub
Include a clear README with:

Project overview

Dataset description

Methods used

Key findings (including the limitations)

What you would explore next

Add a Reflection section like the one you shared.

Optional: include a Next Steps section (e.g., testing other models, adding new variables, incorporating spatial autocorrelation techniques like Moran‚Äôs I or GWR).

üöÄ Bottom Line
Even if the results were weak, the work you did is meaningful. This project will:

Show your technical skills,

Prove your analytical thinking,

And give you a polished portfolio piece ‚Äî as long as you present it well.

If you‚Äôd like help writing or reviewing your README, I‚Äôm happy to assist.
